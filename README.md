This repo contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes a word list in order to determine the best word to start with when playing Wordle.

I'm using Owen Yin's Wordle list from [here](https://medium.com/@owenyin/here-lies-wordle-2021-2027-full-answer-list-52017ee99e86) for the analysis.

I wrote a [blog](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-pandas-to-pick-the-best-first-word-in-wordle-ec2d06b940be) about this analysis as well.
